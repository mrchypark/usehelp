The goal of usehelp is to get help text to use presentation or post.

## Installation

You can install the developing version of usehelp from [github](https://github.com/mrchypark/usehelp) with:

```

## Example

```{r}
library(usehelp)
library(dplyr)
ho <- get_help("tidyr", "unnest")
get_title(ho)
get_usage(ho)
get_description(ho) %>% 
  strsplit("(\\r\\n)+|\\r+|\\n+|\\t+/i") %>% 
  .[[1]]
```
